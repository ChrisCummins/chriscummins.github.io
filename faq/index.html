<h2 id="what-sizes-are-available">What sizes are available?</h2>
<p>Available sizes vary by image. Please see the individual print pages for
specific size options. <a href="/contact/">Contact me</a> to inquire about alternative
print or mount sizes. The minimum size I can print is 8x10 inches and the
maximum size is 20x24 inches.</p>
<p>Please note that image sizes are slightly smaller than the specified paper size
because of border trimming. Paper also shrinks slightly after development. For
example, 8x10 inch prints have a trimmed image area of around 7 1/2 x 9 3/8
inches. Mount board sizes are precise to within 1/4 inch.</p>
<h2 id="what-size-is-best">What size is best?</h2>
<p>For me, personally, I <em>love</em> the 8x10 inch print, particularly when mounted to a
generous 16x20 board. It is my favorite size for collecting other people's work,
and it is also my favorite paper size to work with in the darkroom, so I
discount the price of prints in that size accordingly.</p>
<p>For showpiece display, however, I think bigger is better. Nothing matches the
stopping power of a mounted and framed 20x24 inch print on a wall!</p>
<h2 id="what-materials-do-you-use">What materials do you use?</h2>
<p>I print on fiber paper, typically Ilford Warmtone. I use 8-ply and 4-ply
museum-grade acid free matboard. Prints are mounted using dry mount tissue.
Prints are selenium toned, washed to archival standards, and treated with
Sistan.</p>
<p>For prints which offer a framing option, I use black wooden frames, Tru Vue
Optium Museum Acrylic, and seal them with acid-free backing paper.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-limited-editions-work">How do limited editions work?</h2>
<p>Prints have limited editions that apply across all print sizes. Prints are
numbered sequentially (e.g., 15/50) in the order they are sold. Prices increase
as editions progress to reflect scarcity.</p>
<p>Additionally, I reserve 10 Artist Proofs of each photograph for personal use,
exhibition, and donation. Artist Proofs are not available for sale.</p>
<h2 id="how-should-i-care-for-my-print">How should I care for my print?</h2>
<p>Gelatin silver prints love to be displayed under bright lighting. If you want to
get technical, aim for EV 7.6 at ISO 100/21° with a temperature of 5000K.
However, intense direct sunlight should be avoided, as with high humidity. When
framed under UV-filtering glass or acrylic, prints will last for generations.
Avoid touching the print surface directly. If unframed, handle prints by the
mount only. Store flat in a cool, dry location away from light.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-receive-a-print">How long does it take to receive a print?</h2>
<p>Prints are made to order. Please allow up to 12 weeks for completion. I can
sometimes provide prints faster depending on current availability. <a href="/contact/">Contact
me</a> to inquire about specific timelines or prints I may have on hand.</p>
<h2 id="how-are-prints-shipped">How are prints shipped?</h2>
<p>Prints are carefully packaged in rigid protective materials and shipped via
insured carrier. For international shipments, customs and import duties are the
responsibility of the buyer. All prints are shipped from California.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-your-return-policy">What is your return policy?</h2>
<p>I want you to love your prints. If you are not entirely satisfied with them,
please return them to me for a full refund. I do not refund shipping costs.
Prints must be returned to me in original condition. I recommend using the same
packaging I used to send it.</p>
<p>If your print arrives damaged during shipping, please contact me immediately
with photos of the damage and packaging.</p>
<p><em>Thank you for your interest in my work.</em></p>
