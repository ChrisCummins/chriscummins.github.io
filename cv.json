To benchmark current and future learning techniques for compiler analyses we introduce an open dataset of 461k Intermediate Representation files for LLVM, covering five source programming languages, and 15.4M corresponding data flow results. We formulate data flow analysis as an MPNN and show that standard analyses can be learned, yielding improved performance on downstream compiler optimization tasks."
