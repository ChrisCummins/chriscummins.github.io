# Hello.

I'm Chris, a full time geek and research student with a passion for
developing great software, often late at night. Ask me about open
source, Linux, obscure LISP dialects, or 1960's Russian surfing rock.

I'm currently looking for a **job**! Take a look at my [CV](/cv)
and drop me an [email](mailto:chrisc.101@gmail.com), I'd love to have
a chat. ;-)
