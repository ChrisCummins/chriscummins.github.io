The form of an image is more important to me than its subject.<p>For me, a beautiful black and white print on a wall is as good as it gets. It started when I first saw Ansel Adams's <em>Clearing Winter Storm</em>. At the time I knew nothing about the history, the technique, or even where in the world Yosemite Valley was located, but I was completely stunned by it. I did not know that a photograph could contain such mystery, drama, and beauty. I found it profoundly moving and that effect has only deepened with time.<p>I believe in the value of craftsmanship, of images made slowly and deliberately, and I hope to share that with you through the prints that I make.</div><div><h2>Biography</h2><p>Chris Cummins was born in 1991 in London, England. He began making photographs at an early age — wearing out his first three 35mm cameras — drawn always to landscapes and analog processes.<p>He photographs primarily in California's Sierra Nevada, the eastern deserts, and along the coast. As of 2024, he works exclusively with an 8x10 view camera and gelatin silver printing. He has studied with noted large format photographers Lynn Radeka, Alan Ross, and John Sexton. His primary photographic influences are Brett Weston and Bill Brandt.<p>His love for creative problem solving extends beyond photography. He has a PhD in artificial intelligence and works in the field of mathematical reasoning. He lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife and two dogs.</div></div><div class=about-content style=margin-top:2em><div class=button-row style=justify-content:center><a class=btn href=../photographs/>View Photographs</a><a class=btn href=../shop/>Collect Prints</a></div></div></article></main><footer><div class=container><p>© 2025 Chris Cummins | <a href=../contact/>Contact</a></div></footer>
