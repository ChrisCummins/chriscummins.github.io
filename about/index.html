            <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>I aim to make bold, simple, and striking photographs of wilderness landscapes.</p>
<p>I seek high contrast and graphic simplicity in my photographs. The form of an
image is more important to me than its subject.</p>
<p>For me, a beautiful black and white print on a wall is as good as it gets. It
started when I first saw Ansel Adams's <em>Clearing Winter Storm</em>. At the time I
knew nothing about the history, the technique, or even where in the world
Yosemite Valley was located, but I was completely stunned by it. I did not know
that a photograph could contain such mystery, drama, and beauty. I found it
profoundly moving and that effect has only deepened with time.</p>
<p>I believe in the value of craftsmanship, of images made slowly and deliberately,
and I hope to share that with you through the prints that I make.</p>

            <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Chris Cummins was born in 1991 in London, England. He began making photographs
at an early age — wearing out his first 35mm camera — drawn always to landscapes
and analog processes.</p>
<p>He photographs primarily in California's Sierra Nevada, the eastern deserts, and
along the coast. As of 2024, he works exclusively with an 8x10 view camera and
gelatin silver printing. He has studied with noted large format photographers
Lynn Radeka, Alan Ross, and John Sexton. His primary photographic influences are
Brett Weston and Bill Brandt.</p>
<p>His love for creative problem solving extends beyond photography. He has a PhD
in artificial intelligence and works in the field of mathematical reasoning. He
lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife and two dogs.</p>

        <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>I practice gelatin silver printmaking, a traditional darkroom process where
light-sensitive paper is exposed through a photographic negative and developed
in chemical baths. Local adjustments to brightness and contrast are made by
selectively adding or holding back light to parts of the image, usually by
shading with a hand or a piece of card. Many of the photographs in my shop have
<a href="/shop/367/recipe/">printing notes</a> so you can see how <a href="/shop/367/">the print</a> is made.</p>
<p>From fieldwork to finished print, no computers are used in the making of my
photographs. Darkroom printing is a delightfully low tech process in which each
image is "performed" to a metronome. The finished print is a unique physical
object created directly from the negative.</p>
