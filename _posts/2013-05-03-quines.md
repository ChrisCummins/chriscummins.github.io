title: Quines

I first heard about <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)">Quines</a> a couple of
days ago, and being a computer nerd with an instinctive desire for the bizarre,
I thought I'd give it a try. Picking Java as the instrument of choice, I was
disappointed to find that some of the more [exotic
hacks](http://www.reficio.org/2010/01/25/hardcore-java-quine-and-backward-quine/)
have been broken now that the JVM requires a main method declaration.

My best effort scraped in at just under the 250 char margin:

```java
class q{public static void main(String[]m){String[]$={
"class q{public static void main(String[]m){String[]$={
","};char_=34;System.out.println($[0]+_+$[0]+_+','+_+
$[1]+_+$[1]);}}"};char_=34;System.out.println($[0]+_+
$[0]+_+','+_+$[1]+_+$[1]);}}
```

And for future reference, my personal Quine test routine:

```sh
$ java q > q.out && diff q.java q.out && rm q.out && wc -c q.java | awk '{print $1}'
246
```
