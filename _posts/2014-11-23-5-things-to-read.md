title: 5 things I wish I read 5 months ago
---

One of the few common factors among every PhD student's experience is
the sheer wealth of reading that is required, especially in the first
few months. This post contains 5 recommendations for essential reading
that would have served me well before starting my PhD.

1. [The illustrated guide to a Ph.D.](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/)
   This 5 minute read contains an excellent deconstruction of the PhD
   process, and helped clarify the exact purpose and nature of a
   PhD. Essential reading, and I send this link to anyone who wants to
   better understand what it is I am doing.

1. [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0091906814). I
   have serious reservations about this book's title, as it paints a
   rather exploitative picture which would appear to target the sort
   of people who think that friends are "won" and that influence is
   learned rather than earned. In actuality, the book is a set of
   short stories and anecdotes, tied into a loose narrative, that
   reaffirms the (largely common sense) importance of considering
   other peoples' opinions and interests in order to effectively
   communicate. A PhD is a very personal journey to becoming a world
   expert, the success of which relies largely on your ability to
   communicate and interact well with peers and superiors whose
   opinions and interests may not coincide with your own. This book
   does a great job of providing an explicit framework for improving
   the quality of these interactions.
1. [The Elements of Style](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/020530902X).
   The primary medium of communicating research is the written
   word. For this reason, the importance of the ability to write
   clearly, succinctly, and using good English cannot be
   understated. This book is considered by many to be the authority on
   good writing style.
1. [The Ph.D. Grind](http://pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir/pguo-PhD-grind.pdf). The
   PhD Grind contains a well written and entertaining account of one
   man's journey as a PhD student. It portrays an intimate story of
   their mistakes and regrets, and gives the reader a real
   understanding of what they went through. While everyone's
   experience is different, this memoir contains a unique insight
   which I found thought provoking and useful for contrasting my own
   experiences against.
1. [124 research papers](http://scholar.google.co.uk/). Gaining a
   reasonable grasp of your particular field of research requires an
   *exhausting* amount of background reading. The only way to read the
   amount of papers which is required is by developing the skill of
   academic reading - the ability to quickly gain an understanding of
   the purpose, methods, strengths, and weaknesses of a paper, without
   having to perform a cover to cover read. While there are many
   guides around which aim to help develop the skill, I found the best
   way to improve was by *practise*. In my first month as a PhD
   student I read 124 research papers. Had I started this reading
   process earlier, I would have been able to hit the ground running
   at a greater pace, able to make quicker progress in those initial
   formative months in which you hone your research topic through
   extensive literature review.

This list reflects only my personal experience, but I feel that the
recommendations cover a wide enough variety of topics to be a worthy
read for any student preparing to start a PhD. There will be a *lot*
of reading, so the earlier you start, the better.
