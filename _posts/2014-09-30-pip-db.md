The Protein Isoelectric Point Database (pip-db) is a search engine of
biological data, developed over nine months as part of my Masters of
Engineering degree at Aston University. The project was a cooperative
effort between the Computer Science and Life and Health Sciences
departments; and was an interdisciplinary project, involving elements
of search engine and database design, bioinformatics, web application
development, interaction design, data mining, and automated testing.

This post collates my assessed academic submissions for the
project. In addition, the following two web resources will be of use
to anyone interested in the project:

 * The website: [http://www.pip-db.org/](http://www.pip-db.org/).
 * The source code: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ChrisCummins/pip-db).
