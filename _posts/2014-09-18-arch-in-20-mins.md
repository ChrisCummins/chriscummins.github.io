title: Arch Linux in 20 minutes
---

Arch Linux is a *fantastic* operating system. From bleeding edge
rolling release packages to a stripped back and industrial feel to the
design, Arch grants a feeling of empowerment to the user that is
unmatched by most.

Around two years ago I became somewhat tired of the distro hopping and
configuration tweaking that had been engaging me previously, and I
decided to opt for the quieter and a more stable Debian system in
order to be able to focus more of my attention on software
development. More recently I decided to give Arch another chance after
being convinced by a couple of my colleagues, and was delighted to
find that the distro has come along way from when we last parted, the
days of System V init and handwritten `xorg.conf` files.

As always, the installation process for Arch is significantly more
involved than most (though [not](https://www.gentoo.org/)
[all](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)) distros, so I decided to
write up my installation approach for the latest (2014.09.03) release,
which should result in a complete development machine in around 20
minutes.

*Disclaimer:* This guide assumes that the reader has a reasonable
 working knowledge of Linux OSs, and chooses a selection of packages
 which may not be to everyone's taste. The authoritative source of
 installation instructions is the
 [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners'_guide). Assumed
 hardware is a desktop machine with a wired ethernet connection and UK
 keyboard.

ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/London /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc --utc

# Edit hosts file to add your hostname to the end of this line:
#    127.0.0.1	localhost.localdomain	localhost	cec
nano /etc/hosts
export HOSTNAME=cec
echo $HOSTNAME > /etc/hostname


# Find out the name of your LAN device:
ip link show

# Enable dhcpcd for that device:
systemctl enable dhcpcd@[internet-device].service

lspci | grep -e VGA -e 3D
pacman -Ss xf86-video
pacman -S [video-driver]

# Install some useful packages:
pacman -S gptfdisk syslinux vim xorg-server xorg-xinit xterm zsh \
wget rsync openssh

# Uncomment appropriate line to enable sudo access to wheel group:
EDITOR=nano visudo

# Install bootloader:
syslinux-install_update -iam

# Change LABEL from /dev/sda3 to /dev/sda1 for LABELs:
# And set: TIMEOUT 1
nano /boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg

# Set keymap:
echo KEYMAP=uk > /etc/vconsole.conf

# Set root password:
passwd

# Create user and set password:
useradd -G wheel -s /bin/zsh chris
passwd chris

exit
reboot

# Login as root

# For virtualbox guests:
