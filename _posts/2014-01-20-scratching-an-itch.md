title: Scratching an Itch
---

The title of this post may seem misleading in that it is *not* about
scratching ones balls. Instead, it refers to a quote from the
venerable Eric S. Raymond in his book the
*[Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/)*:

> Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's
> personal itch.

Recently I had the rare luxury to write what I believe to be a **good
work of software**. It doesn't have any fancy algorithms and it
doesn't invent any new kinds of data structures, but what it does do
is to **fix a problem** and **save time**. Is that not what computers
were built for?
