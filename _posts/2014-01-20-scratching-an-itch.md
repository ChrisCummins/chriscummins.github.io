The venerable Eric S. Raymond in his book the *[Cathedral and the
Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/)*
says:

Recently I had the rare luxury to write what I believe to be a **good
work of software**. It doesn't have any fancy algorithms and it
doesn't invent any new kinds of data structures, but what it does do
is to **fix a problem** and **save time**. Is that not what computers
were built for?
