title: Quick HDD Health Check
---

Recently I have had to deal with two hardware disk failures in quick
succession, which has led to two changes:

1. A much increased pace of development on
   [emu](/posts/emu-by-example/) (more on that soon!).
2. Taking a more programmatic and astute approach to keeping on eye on
   system health.

In order to facilitate the second point, I adapted a simple one-liner
from this
[disk cloning with ddrescue](http://www.kossboss.com/linux---how-to-clone-a-disk-with-ddrescue---dnu-ddrescue-also-known-as-gddrescue---the-better-ddrescue-tool)
tutorial in order to provide a quick and simple overview of the health of hard drives:

```
for i in $(ls /dev/sd[a-z]); do echo "=== $i ==="; \
sudo smartctl -a $i | egrep --color=never -i \
"reallocated_sector|ata error|serial|model|user capacity"; \
sudo smartctl -H $i &>/dev/null || sudo smartctl -H $i; echo; done;
```

Example output for a system with 5 drives, the fourth of which
(`/dev/sdd`) is failing:

```

```

And here is the command in expanded form. Note that it runs the SMART
health check, and will show the output is the test fails.

```
for i in $(ls /dev/sd[a-z]); do
    echo "=== $i ==="
    sudo smartctl -a $i | egrep --color=never \
        -i "reallocated_sector|ata error|serial|model|user capacity"
    sudo smartctl -H $i &>/dev/null || sudo smartctl -H $i
    echo
done
```

Note also that this depends on the `smartctl` binary, which is
probably not included in most default distributions. In Debian, you
need to apt-get the `smartmontools` package:

```
sudo apt-get install smartmontools
```
