Whilst sifting through the old code for the most recent [site redesign]({% post_url 2017-06-08-site-revamp %}) I stumbled across a stale git branch which had been untouched for the past three years, and with the cryptic name `wip/386`. Intrigued that it appeared to have diverged from master significantly, I fixed it up to run on the latest Jekyll stack, and was delighted to discover that it appeared to be a complete overhaul of the site design with a somewhat.. esoteric aesthetic.

Lord knows what I was thinking, but it made me chuckle so I've hosted it on it's own project as an archive of my 2014-era website sensibilities. You can check it out here:
