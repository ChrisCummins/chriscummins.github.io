title: On writing crap posts, quickly

By way of follow up to my [last post](/2014/crap-code-quickly), I
think it's interesting that I seem to have the opposite problem when
it comes to writing blog posts. While I'll happily dive into writing a
program with little concern for planning or testing, I take a much
more reserved attitude towards writing these blog posts, adopting
something of a perfectionist attitude towards them.

This is harming my output, making me too hesitant to get things online
and published. I have a half dozen unfinished posts lying around
waiting to some day be finally revised, and at least a dozen or more
unresolved ideas for posts.

My reaction to this is to take something of a more results driven
attitude towards getting blog posts up and online with a short
turnaround time. The topic of high vs low output was discussed
entertainingly on a recent
[Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/8) podcast
episode, and I will endeavour to adopt a more Brady-esque attitude
towards getting stuff done in the future.

After all, if the main reason for not writing is fear over my writing
inadequacy, then surely the only cure is more practise?
