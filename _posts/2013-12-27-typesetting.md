title: Typesetting the LaTeX way
---

I love text. Naturally. I mean, between programming, University work,
emails and sexting, I spend around 50 hours a week doing the "digit
dance" to make words appear on a glass screen in front of me. As a
consequence, I'm obsessed with the appearance of type, and those
neatly formatted PDFs generated by `LaTeX` has for a long time been my
ideal of what nice typesetting looks like.

Recently, I came across two wonderful projects which allowed me take
my filthy `LaTeX` fetish in a whole new web direction:

## Computer Modern for the Web

Christian Perfect's work on enabling
[Computer Modern on the web](http://checkmyworking.com/cm-web-fonts/)
is amazing. I *love* Knuth's aesthetic, and the possibility of
bringing those delightfully janky fonts to a website near you made my
day. Here's a before and after of Lato vs Computer Modern Bright:

It was just a simple case of importing the right font into my style
sheet and I was on my way. Now that the choice of font has been made,
we can now focus on one of the more refined aspects of the `LaTeX`
style:

## JavaScript Hyphenation

The ability to lay out beautiful solid blocks of text is one of
`LaTeX`'s strongest points. The key to this is a
[fantastic line-breaking algorithm](http://defoe.sourceforge.net/folio/knuth-plass.html)
implemented by Knuth and Plass, that understands how and when to break
words and lines in a way which surpasses many more common
alternatives. CSS3 introduced a number of new properties to help
approximate decent text justification, but there's nothing quite like
the real thing, and that's exactly what Bram Stein has achieved in his
JavaScript implementation of the
[Knuth Plass algorithm](https://github.com/bramstein/typeset).

Unfortunately, it seems too basic to be used with formatted text which
contains nested HTML (the algorithm splits the text based on words,
discarding all HTML), but thankfully Stein's
[Hyphenation Engine](http://www.bramstein.com/projects/hypher/) proves
capable of performing the majority of the heavy lifting, with the CSS
`text-justify: newspaper` attribute being able to complete the job,
providing a pretty decent approximation. The hypher jQuery plugin is
extremely easy to use, boiling down to something along the lines of:

```html
<script src="jquery.hypher.js"></script>
<script>$('p').hyphenate('en-gb');</script>
```

Here's a before and after screenshot of plain old CSS justified text
(left), and the same justified text after hyphenating with Bram's
`hypher` package. The difference, while subtle, is convincing:

To my eyes, those two changes made the text on this whole site come
alive. But hey, such is the power of confirmation bias, right?
