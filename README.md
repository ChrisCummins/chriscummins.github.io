It is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

## Running the site locally

2. Install bundle: `gem install bundler`.
3. Install site dependencies: `bundle install`.
4. Build and serve: `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --host=0.0.0.0`.
