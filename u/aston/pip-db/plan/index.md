###### Formal feedback

This is an exceptionally well thought out project plan based around
standard methodology for a final year project and is certainly first
class.

The student has done good research on the problem. One area which
perhaps needed more intention was in understanding the users and their
typical usage pattern which would affect both the user interface
design and the database structure. The plan appears to be realistic
and efficient with clearly defined milestones. I would have liked to
see actual dates - not just week numbers.

It is important to ensure there is enough scope for originality to
access the highest possible marks at the end of the project.
